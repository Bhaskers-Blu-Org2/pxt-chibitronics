## Step 1: Creating your Variables 

In this step, we'll be creating 5 different variables to control each LED. We'll be controlling each separate from each other! 

Variables act as placeholders of values that can be substituted many times into a function. 

* From **VARIABLES**, click **Make a Variable** and name it ``brightness_0``. 
* Repeat the following process 5 more times, naming your variables ``brightness_1``, ``brightness_2``, ``brightness_3``, ``brightness_4``, and ``brightness_5``. 

```block
(brightness_0)
(brightness_1)
(brightness_2)
(brightness_3)
(brightness_4)
(brightness_5) 
``` 

## Step 2: Setting up your Variables 

The next thing we need to do is define a value for our variables. This allows the system to run code using your variable in place of a value.

* From **CONTROL**, drag an **on start** block into your workspace. 
* From **VARIABLES**, drag a **set item to** block into your **on start** loop. 

```blocks 
let brightness_0 = 0 
brightness_0 = 0
```

## Build the block... 
* From the dropdown, select ``brightness_0`` in place of **item**. 

By setting ``brightness_0``, this tells any code that uses the variable that the starting value is 0. Let's repeat this step with our other 5 variables you created earlier! 

```blocks 
let brightness_0 = 0 
let brightness_1 = 0 
let brightness_2 = 0 
let brightness_3 = 0 
let brightness_4 = 0 
let brightness_5 = 0
brightness_0 = 0
brightness_1 = 0 
brightness_2 = 0
brightness_3 = 0 
brightness_4 = 0 
brightness_5 = 0 
```
